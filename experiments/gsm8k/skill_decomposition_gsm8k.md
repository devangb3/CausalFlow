  - mathematical goal alignment (count=2): The ability to map a specific problem requirement to the correct mathematical operation. Failure occurs when the agent identifies a valid sub-component of the problem but applies an operation that does not directly advance toward the requested metric.
  - complementary value derivation (count=1): The ability to identify whether a calculation should target the primary value or its complement based on the goal. Failure occurs when the agent calculates the value for the state described (occupied) rather than the state requested (unoccupied).
  - goal-oriented logic formulation (count=1): The ability to align mathematical operations with the specific objective of the query. The failure involves calculating a new state (remaining consumption) instead of the requested delta (savings).
  - mathematical operator selection (count=1): The ability to select the correct arithmetic operation to represent a logical relationship between quantities. Failure occurs when an agent applies an operation (e.g., subtraction) that does not align with the intended semantic goal (e.g., calculating a total count).
  - multi-step goal tracking (count=1): The ability to maintain and execute the final objective of a multi-part problem after completing intermediate sub-tasks. Failure occurs when the agent stops after a sub-calculation instead of performing the final comparative or integrative step.
  - instruction adherence (count=1): The ability to align reasoning steps with the specific constraints of the user's query. The failure occurs when the agent solves for a sub-component or intermediate value instead of the final metric requested.
  - goal-state alignment (count=1): The ability to map a calculated result back to the specific metric requested in the problem statement. Failure occurs when the agent correctly calculates a sub-component (e.g., remaining time) but fails to incorporate the initial state to satisfy the 'total' requirement.
  - problem constraint interpretation (count=1): The ability to correctly map natural language descriptors to mathematical variables. Failure occurs when the agent confuses the quantity to be calculated (e.g., 'left/unused') with its complement (e.g., 'used').
  - semantic requirement mapping (count=1): The ability to correctly map natural language problem requirements to mathematical operations. The failure occurs when the agent confuses cost components with revenue/earnings components in the final calculation.
  - semantic problem modeling (count=1): The ability to correctly map natural language problem constraints into a logical mathematical model. Failure occurs when the agent misinterprets the relationship between entities, such as confusing costs with earnings.

- Member skill labels:
  - mathematical strategy optimization (count=1): The ability to select the most efficient computational path to a solution. Failure occurs when an agent performs redundant intermediate calculations (calculating occupied units) instead of directly calculating the complement (unoccupied units) required by the goal.
  - computational plan optimization (count=1): The ability to design an efficient sequence of operations by identifying common units or simplifying steps before execution. Failure occurs when the agent chooses a redundant conversion path (converting all units to a smaller unit and back) rather than maintaining the target unit throughout.
  - computational strategy optimization (count=1): The ability to identify the most efficient sequence of operations to reach a goal. Failure occurs when the agent introduces unnecessary intermediate calculations that do not contribute to the final required value.
  - constraint-based optimization reasoning (count=1): The ability to evaluate multiple variables against a cost-efficiency metric to maximize an output. The failure occurs when the agent defaults to a 'cheapest unit' heuristic instead of calculating the 'yield per dollar' across all available options.
  - optimization strategy formulation (count=1): The ability to identify the correct objective function and constraints to maximize a value. The failure occurs when the agent selects a heuristic (cheapest unit cost) that does not align with the global optimization goal.
  - Constraint-based strategy selection (count=1): The ability to identify and prioritize the most efficient variable (cost-per-unit) before performing calculations. Failure occurs when the agent initiates brute-force calculations without first evaluating which resource provides the highest yield per unit of cost.
  - strategic optimization logic (count=1): The ability to evaluate and compare different scenarios or resource allocations to find an optimal solution rather than following a single linear path. Failure occurs when the agent pursues a sub-optimal branch without exploring alternative configurations.
  - multi-tier pricing logic (count=1): The ability to correctly apply bulk discount rules or tiered pricing structures when calculating total costs. Failure occurs when the agent defaults to a simple unit price calculation instead of optimizing for the most cost-effective combination of bulk and individual rates.
